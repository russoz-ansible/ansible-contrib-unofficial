Motivations
===========

I am a generalist at heart - because I am curious about almost any topic that crosses my path, 
but also because I tend to get bored if I stick with the same set of tasks for too long. Like
everything in life, this comes with a price, and one of tolls I pay is that I forget things
that have not surfaced for a while, sometimes more than I would like to. Writing things down 
help me fixate them on my memory, so that's the main drive for starting this. But, alas, while 
at it I might as well make it public and help others.

I started contributing to Ansible's [community.general collection](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general)
on July 2020. By now I maintain a number of modules in the c.g. collection, but every now and then I have to do something on
some module, and I forget how to do that. So there you have it.
