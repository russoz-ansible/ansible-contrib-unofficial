Ansible Contributor Unofficial Cheat Guide
==========================================

An unofficial documentation set for the Ansible module contributor. For the time being this guide is significantly biased towards the community.general collection, and more specifically towards Ansible modules. In the long run we should want to cover more collections and plugin types.

* [Ansible Versions](/ansible-versions.md)
* [Writing a Module](/mod-writing.md)
* [Testing a Module](/mod-testing.md)
* [Submitting a Pull Request](/submitting-pr.md)
* [Deprecations](/deprecations.md)

## Why this?

You can read about my motivations to do this in [here](/motivations.md).
